<pre><code>Play with virtual Lego blocks and create your own plans!
This is Lego's official (discontinued) brick design program. With it, you can build your own sets within the editor and paint the pieces any color you wish.
Afterwards, you can generate step-by-step building plans and print them out. Or you could place your creation into a desert background and take a picture of it to share with friends.

This program runs extremely well on RPi. The only problem I (Botspot) could find was the sound effects don't work.

<pre><code>OpenSCAD is software for creating solid 3D CAD models.

Unlike most free software for creating 3D models, OpenSCAD does not focus on
the artistic aspects of 3D modelling but instead on the CAD aspects.
OpenSCAD is more suitable for creating 3D models of machine parts but
perhaps not when creating computer-animated movies.

OpenSCAD is not an interactive modeller. Instead OpenSCAD is something like
a 3D-compiler that reads in a script file that describes the object
and renders the 3D model from this script file. This gives designers
full control over the modelling process and enables them to easily
change any step in the modelling process or make designs that are
defined by configurable parameters.

Once Chiaki is running, you can enter the settings menu (top right) to configure general/stream settings to your liking. Note that stream quality options are limited depending on your console. To connect and use a controller with Chiaki, please refer to the Pi fork wiki.
In most cases, Chiaki will automatically detect your console if it's turned on. Otherwise, you can add it manually by pressing the "+" icon (top right) and entering your console's IP address.

To finalize the registration, two more parameters need to be set.
PSN AccountID: In a terminal, enter "python3 Chiaki/psn-account-id.py" and follow the instructions.
Registration PIN:
On a PS4, go to: Settings -&gt; Remote Play -&gt; Add Device;
On a PS5, go to: Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Remote Play -&gt; Link Device.

You can now double-click your console in Chiaki's main window to start remote play!

- It's easy to use and to setup.
- It is well-maintained and has a vibrant support community.
- It supports Microsoft and Mojang accounts.
- This fork of Lunar for ARM includes Optifine, automatically switches lwjgl libraries (for playing older versions), and includes other optimizations by default.
- It's easy to install in a self contained AppImage.

<pre><code>Lokinet is a privacy focused network anyone can access using the latest in decentralized onion routing technology.

Lokinet requires no internet IP Address but instead provides it's own network addresses which can be either ephemeral, persistent or personalized depending on the users desired application. Information is onion routed through a globally distributed network of over one thousand nodes.

Hosting on Lokinet is quite easy and allows users to instantly create static addresses that can be privately accessed remotely over the internet for hosting their own online content. Using a Lokinet "SNApp" alleviates many of the challenges associated with hosting when it comes to configuring ports on a network. WIth SNApps there are no ports to forward. SNApps can be easily hosted on as little as an SBC inside a network and privately accessible anywhere in the world. SNApps also can hosted on a VPN using webservers such as Nginx, Apache, python etc. thereby allowing private anonymized global access your own personal content or sharing content privately among other users of the network. Web based applications such as IRC, Mumble, PeerTube, Pleroma, forums, streaming content etc. are all supportable through the network. The location and origin of the server is hidden and users anonymized while additionally the server can be secured in traditional ways. One can also register custom domains if they so choose to but this is not required to immediately generate a static address.

Users wishing to access the regular internet anonymously need not pay for access to use Lokinet but may chose to subscribe to an exit provider should they wish to enhance anonymous access the internet through such a provider. Additionally the network generally has free exit nodes available offered through individuals providing voluntary support to the network.

Currently the Oxen Privacy Tech Foundation offers free Lokinet exit node access at address "exit.loki". A wiki for Lokinet is located at https://wiki.oxen.io/wiki/Main_Page

Package app</p>
<pre><code>Open-source version of Google Chrome.
If you are using Raspberry Pi OS, this browser has been optimized by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to include hardware acceleration and other various performance improvements.

To play Netflix, Spotify, or other protected multimedia streams, see the Chromium Widevine app.
To install an older version of Chromium, see the Downgrade Chromium app.

Chromium supports numerous flags to enable extra features. You can add these flags either manually (by running chromium-browser in a terminal), or by adding the flag to a file in the /etc/chromium/customizations folder.
Here's how that works: Inside the /etc/chromium/customizations folder there will be one or more files. On most systems there will already be a 00-rpi-vars file there. You can add flags to it, or create a new file. In all cases, be sure it starts with:
CHROMIUM_FLAGS="${CHROMIUM_FLAGS}
And be sure it ends with this character: "

Now that you know how to add flags to Chromium, here are some useful ones:
- Enable Google Chrome Sync: --oauth2-client-id=77185425430.apps.googleusercontent.com --oauth2-client-secret=OTJgUOQcT7lO7GsGZq2G4IlT
    This flag is discussed in the Raspberry Pi Forums: https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=314477
- Enable dark mode: --force-dark-mode
    If you want more themes, go visit the Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/themes
- Change the scale of the browser window: --force-device-scale-factor=1.3
    The default is 1 - smaller values will shrink the interface, while larger values will grow the interface.
- More chromium flags can be found on this website: https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches

Chromium 65, 72, 74, 78, 84, 86, 88, 92, and 95.
Uninstall the app to go back to the latest Chromium version available.
Beware that downgrading Chromium versions can mess up your config folder. To be safe, this app makes a backup of Chromium's config folder. When uninstalling, you will have the opportunity to restore the backup config folder.

<pre><code>Feature-rich screen recorder for X11 and OpenGL
Simple Screen Recorder is, despite its name, an actually feature-rich screen recorder. The name reflects the fact that it is simple to use unlike many other free screen recording applications available. It can be easily configured to start recording from an intuitive wizard-like interface.

It can record the entire screen or part of it directly.  The recording can be paused and resumed at any time. Many different file formats and codecs are supported. To perform an X11 recording, all it takes is selecting an area on the root window with the mouse, choosing an output file and pressing record, either by using the mouse or using a hotkey.

It has a Qt-based graphical user interface.

Its complexity becomes apparent in its powerful features. It allows one to record X11 screen areas and fullscreen OpenGL applications including sound supporting both ALSA, PulseAudio, JACK and OSS. It uses libavformat to encode the recorded material into a variety of video formats. Scaling the recorded video is possible as well as configuring the encoding quality for the codec chosen directly from the user interface.

To run: Menu -&gt; Accessories -&gt; WoR-Flasher
To run the graphical interface in a terminal: ~/wor-flasher/install-wor-gui.sh
To run the command-line interface in a terminal: ~/wor-flasher/install-wor.sh

If you encounter problems, we recommend you run WoR-flasher in a terminal to catch any errors.

<pre><code>Run x86 Windows apps with a box86-emulated version of x86 wine.
To run: wine path/to/file.exe
To configure wine: go to 'Wine configuration' in main menu or type in terminal: wine winecfg
Not all Windows applications will work under Wine. It's a good idea to check online if your program can run, or if something can be tweaked to make it work.

Note: the applications installed with wine will appear under the wine category in the main menu, and they will stay there even after uninstalling wine.

Need support with running a game or app with wine and box86? Ask it on the Pi Labs Discord: https://discord.gg/JKNQXprqUd
